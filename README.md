### Hi there 👋
😀 I am Kuan-Lin Chen, a college student at NPTU.

🏫 I have a great research interest in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL) and generative AI. 

✌️ This github stores some of my programming projects, many of which were created when practicing programming.

🔭 I am currently working as a research assistant.

🌱 I am currently learning natural language processing (NLP) and some of the latest developments in AI.
