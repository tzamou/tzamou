### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Kuan-Lin Chen, a college student at NPTU
I have a great research interest in artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL) and generative AI. 
This github stores some of my programming projects, many of which were created when practicing programming.
